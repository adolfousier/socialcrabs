# ClawSocial Notification Templates

**MANDATORY REFERENCE** — All notifications MUST match these templates exactly.

---

## Agent-Driven Comment System

ClawSocial uses an **agent-driven approach** for comments:

1. **Agent reads the content** (tweet, article, post)
2. **Agent reads VOICE.md** for the user's style guide
3. **Agent generates a unique, contextual comment**
4. **Comment is logged** to prevent repetition

### VOICE.md Example
```markdown
# VOICE.md — Comment Style Guide

## Core Rules
- **8th grade reading level** — simple words, short sentences
- **Max 2 sentences** — most comments should be 1 sentence
- **10-25 words** — if it's longer, cut it
- **Ask questions** — engage, don't lecture

## ✅ DO — Real Examples
"15x performance improvement is wild. What's your content strategy?"
"Spot on analogy 💯"
"That's exactly it."
"Smart move. Context switching between AIs is painful."

## ❌ DON'T — AI Patterns to Avoid
"Fascinating approach!"
"Excellent analysis!"
"Love this systematic approach!"
"The intersection of X and Y is where things get really interesting"
```

## Storage: Comment Logs

To avoid repetition, log all comments:

```bash
# Append to comment log
echo "$(date +%Y-%m-%d\ %H:%M) | @username | Your comment text" >> ~/clawd/x-comments.txt
```

**Format:**
```
# ~/clawd/x-comments.txt
2026-02-06 15:30 | @user1 | That's wild. What stack?
2026-02-06 15:45 | @user2 | Spot on 💯
2026-02-06 16:03 | @user3 | Smart move. Did it work?
```

Before commenting, read the log to avoid similar phrases.
